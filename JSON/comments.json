I remember finding one pretty fox in the woods with my husband. We had a forest near our house so it was very easy to find pretty animals outhere. And what a house dear... Built back in the days of glorious United States. I really miss the old days. How old are you? I guess your are a really smart kid who built all of this. I myself don't understand very good this tech things but my niece helps me out. Ohh what a pretty young girl, I guess you two would be great friend... or something else... you know little boy? hahaha. Well, you know what?
