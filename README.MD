# Forever (SocialMedia)
###### This project was made in 3 days by a team of 4 people. We made a social network which is totally functional and allow more than one person to interact. It's not perfect and clearly has some vulnerabilities, but for the time it was made it's pretty good.

###### There is no github-pages implemented since this project needs to work with PHP to modify JSON files, otherwise it would not be possible to interact with other users.
